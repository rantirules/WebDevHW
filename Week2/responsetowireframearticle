I found the article to be useful as a guide of what should be taken into consideration when designing a wireframe. I didn't know that there were tools available to help you make wireframes and you can create wireframes that have varying interactivity levels. I think I would like to experiment with some of these tools in the future. Fromt the article I now understand the importance of getting feedback early. This is something that I didn't consider as something that was important, previously I thought that you should try and do as much as you can and solicit feedback after you have done what you could, but now I know that if you are working in industry you want feedback as soon as possible.
